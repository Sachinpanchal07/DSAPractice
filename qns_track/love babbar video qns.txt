recursoin best qns ---->

1) factorial
2) counting 
3) Fibonacci
4) binary search
5) 2d array recursion
6) subset of set.
7) phone keypad problem.
8) permutation of string or array.
9) Rate in Maze. (not practice till now will do latter in recurion qns)-slightly confusion.

Linked list --------->
a) split cicular LL in two halfs and make their own heads
b) Reverse doubly LL.

1) Reverse Linked list (linear and recursive approach)
2) Rererse Linked list with K groups
3) Is Linked list is circular (two approach itrative, map)
4) Detect and remove cycle in LL and also give that node which create cycle in LL. (optimize approach)
5) Sort the LL containg 0s, 1s, 2s ( two approachs-> 1)replace data,2) replace pointers )
6) Merge two sorted Linked list. 
7) Check palindrome in LL (two approach --> 1) using stack and array. 2) using pointers only )
8) Add two numbers
