recursoin  qns ---->

1) factorial
2) counting 
3) Fibonacci
4) binary search
5) 2d array recursion
6) subset of set.
7) phone keypad problem.
8) permutation of string or array.
9) Rat in Maze. (not practice till now will do latter in recurion qns)-slightly confusion.

Linked list --------->

a) split cicular LL in two halfs and make their own heads
b) Reverse doubly LL.
c) why merger sort in prefer in LL and quick sort in arrays.
d) flattern Linked list.
e) dsa 450 do Linked list qnestion (enough h).

1) find mid of LL.
2) Reverse Linked list (linear and recursive approach)
3) Rererse Linked list with K groups
4) Is Linked list is circular (two approach itrative, map)
5) Detect and remove cycle in LL and also give that node which create cycle in LL. (optimize approach)
6) Sort the LL containg 0s, 1s, 2s ( two approachs-> 1)replace data,2) replace pointers )
7) Merge two sorted Linked list. 
8) Check palindrome in LL (two approach --> 1) using stack and array. 2) using pointers only )
9) Add two numbers 
10) Merge Sort in Linked list.

Stack--------------->

a) stack implementation using linked list.

1) Stack implementation using array.
2) Revrese a string or array using stack.
3) Remove mid element from stack.
4) Is valid parenthesis.
5) add element in bottom.
6) Reverse stack.
7) Maintain two stacks using one array.
8) Sort stack.
9) redundant brackets.
10) Convert in valid parenthesis with min cost.
11) Find next first smaller element.
12) calculate Max area of rectangle in give array (hard)
13) celebrity problem.
