recursoin  qns ---->

1) factorial
2) counting 
3) Fibonacci
4) binary search
5) 2d array recursion
6) subset of set.
7) phone keypad problem.
8) permutation of string or array.
9) Rat in Maze. (not practice till now will do latter in recurion qns)-slightly confusion.

Linked list --------->

a) split cicular LL in two halfs and make their own heads
b) Reverse doubly LL.
c) why merger sort in prefer in LL and quick sort in arrays.
d) flattern Linked list.
e) dsa 450 do Linked list qnestion (enough h).

1) find mid of LL.
2) Reverse Linked list (linear and recursive approach)
3) Rererse Linked list with K groups
4) Is Linked list is circular (two approach itrative, map)
5) Detect and remove cycle in LL and also give that node which create cycle in LL. (optimize approach)
6) Sort the LL containg 0s, 1s, 2s ( two approachs-> 1)replace data,2) replace pointers )
7) Merge two sorted Linked list. 
8) Check palindrome in LL (two approach --> 1) using stack and array. 2) using pointers only )
9) Add two numbers 
10) Merge Sort in Linked list.

Stack--------------->

a) stack implementation using linked list.
b) implement stack using queue.

1) Stack implementation using array.
2) Revrese a string or array using stack.
3) Remove mid element from stack.
4) Is valid parenthesis.
5) add element in bottom.
6) Reverse stack.
7) Maintain two stacks using one array.
8) Sort stack.
9) redundant brackets.
10) Convert in valid parenthesis with min cost.
11) Find next first smaller element.
12) calculate Max area of rectangle in give array (hard)
13) celebrity problem.
14) Max area of rectangle in binary matrix with all 1's
^15) N stacks in array (will do latter after playlist)
16) get Min value from stack after certain no. of pops.(approach1 done, approach 2 left)

Queue---------------->

a) queue implementation using Linked list.
b) implement queue using stack.

1) Cicular queue.
2) dqueue.
3) Rverse queue.
4) first negative integer in every window of size k queue question solution (samjh nahi aya), edit--> aa gya samjh.
5) reverse k elements of queue
6) first non-repeating character in stream (doubt)
7) petrol pump question. (three approachs)
8) interleave the first half of the queue with second half.(two approachs)
^9) N-queue using the one array.(will do latter after playlist)
10) sum of max element and min element in k size window and  store that sum in array return array (samjh nahi aya) (dry run this must)

Tree------------------>

a) diagonal traversal in tree

1) No. of leaf nodes in tree
2) height of tree
3) diameter of tree(two approaches). **
4) is tree balanced
5) is both tree identical
6) sum tree
	{views qns are important, most of asked in interviews}
7) zig-zag traversal 
8) print boundry nodes of tree
^9) vertical traversal in tree.  edit-> (done)
10) top view of tree
11) bottom view of tree
12) left view of tree
13) right view of tree
